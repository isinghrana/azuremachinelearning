## Summary

Sample Notebooks to demonstrate how to use AutoML feature of Azure Machine Learning Services to create a Machine Learning Model to predict Diabetes likelihood. It also shows how to setup the service so that it can be consumed in Power BI using Azure Machine Learning and Power BI integration features.


### Pre-Requisites
Requires a Azure Machine Learning Workspace an AzureML SDK alongwith AutoML extras. I used [Azure DSVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview) as it comes pre-loaded with most of the dependencies. Refer to SDK installation instructions on the follwoing documentation page - [Installing the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?view=azure-ml-py)
